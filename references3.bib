This review describes the current coding and noncoding genetic and transcriptional mechanisms mediating carbapenem and polymyxin resistance, respectively. ABSTRACT: The spread of carbapenem- and polymyxin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae poses a significant threat to public health, challenging clinicians worldwide with limited therapeutic options. This review describes the current coding and noncoding genetic and transcriptional mechanisms mediating carbapenem and polymyxin resistance, respectively. A systematic review of all studies published in PubMed database between 2015 to October 2020 was performed. Journal articles evaluating carbapenem and polymyxin resistance mechanisms, respectively, were included. The search identified 171 journal articles for inclusion. Different New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) carbapenemase variants had different transcriptional and affinity responses to different carbapenems. Mutations within the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) mobile transposon, Tn4401, affect its promoter activity and expression levels, increasing carbapenem resistance. Insertion of IS26 in \textit{ardK} increased imipenemase expression 53-fold. \textit{ompCF} porin downregulation (mediated by \textit{envZ} and \textit{ompR} mutations), \textit{micCF} small RNA hyperexpression, efflux upregulation (mediated by \textit{acrA}, \textit{acrR}, \textit{araC}, \textit{marA}, \textit{soxS}, \textit{ramA}, etc.), and mutations in \textit{acrAB}-\textit{tolC} mediated clinical carbapenem resistance when coupled with β-lactamase activity in a species-specific manner but not when acting without β-lactamases. Mutations in \textit{pmrAB}, \textit{phoPQ}, \textit{crrAB}, and \textit{mgrB} affect phosphorylation of lipid A of the lipopolysaccharide through the \textit{pmrHFIJKLM} (\textit{arnBCDATEF} or \textit{pbgP}) cluster, leading to polymyxin resistance; \textit{mgrB} inactivation also affected capsule structure. Mobile and induced \textit{mcr}, efflux hyperexpression and porin downregulation, and Ecr transmembrane protein also conferred polymyxin resistance and heteroresistance. Carbapenem and polymyxin resistance is thus mediated by a diverse range of genetic and transcriptional mechanisms that are easily activated in an inducing environment. The molecular understanding of these emerging mechanisms can aid in developing new therapeutics for multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolates.},

This research is aimed to investigate the resistant urinary AmpC-generating E. coli isolates and identify their genetic variety. Some 230 E. coli isolates from patients suffering urinary tract infection symptoms were studied in 2017–2018 to assess their susceptibility toward antimicrobial agents. AmpC gene was evaluated by PCR and molecular typing using the 10-loci MLVA method. MLVA images were examined by BioNumerics 6.6 software through the use of the UPGMA algorithms. Thirty-eight AmpC-generating E. coli isolates were detected. The most abundant determinant was \textit{bla}$_{\text{CIT}}$ and \textit{bla}$_{\text{EBC}}$, \textit{bla}$_{\text{FOX}}$, and \textit{bla}$_{\text{DHA}}$ had the next ranks, respectively. Six major clusters and a singleton were identified by MLVA.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: TEM-, SHV-, and OXA-type β-lactamases were studied by PCR with 124 ampicillin-resistant (AMP$^{\text{r}}$) Escherichia coli isolates recovered from foods of animal origin (n = 20) and feces of humans (n = 49) and healthy animals (n = 55). PCR showed that 103 isolates were positive for TEM and negative for SHV and OXA. Three E. coli isolates showed a positive reaction for OXA, and one showed a positive reaction for SHV. The remaining 17 E. coli isolates were negative for the three enzymes by PCR. Fifty-seven of the 103 \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM}}$ amplicons were sequenced. Different molecular variants of \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-1}}$ were found in 52 isolates: \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-1a}}$ (n = 9), \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-1b}}$ (n = 36), \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-1c}}$ (n = 6), and \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-1f}}$ (n = 1). Four inhibitor-resistant TEM (IRT) β-lactamase-encoding genes were also detected: \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-30c}}$ (IRT-2), \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-34b}}$ (IRT-6), \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-40b}}$ (IRT-11), and \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-51a}}$ (IRT-15). A new \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM}}$ gene, named \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-95b}}$, which showed a mutation in amino acid 145 (P→A) was detected. It was found in a food isolate of chicken origin (AMP$^{\text{r}}$, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid susceptible). The promoter region in 24 \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM}}$ amplicons was analyzed, and the weak P3 promoter was found in 23 of them (\textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-1}}$ in 20 amplicons and \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-51a}}$, \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-30c}}$, and \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-95b}}$ in 1 amplicon each). The strong Pa/Pb promoter was found only in the \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-34b}}$ gene. No extended-spectrum β-lactamases were detected. Mutations at position −42 or −32 in the \textit{ampC} gene promoter were demonstrated in 4 of 10 E. coli isolates for which the cefoxitin MIC was ≥16 μg/ml. Different variants of \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-1}}$ and IRT \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM}}$ genes were found among the AMP$^{\text{r}}$ E. coli isolates from foods and the feces of humans and healthy animals, and a new gene, \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-95b}}$ (P3), was detected.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), first described in the United States in 1996, is now a widespread global problem in several Gram-negative species. A worldwide surveillance study collected Gram-negative pathogens from 202 global sites in 40 countries during 2012 to 2014 and determined susceptibility to β-lactams and other class agents by broth microdilution testing. Molecular mechanisms of β-lactam resistance among carbapenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were determined using PCR and sequencing. Genes encoding KPC enzymes were found in 586 isolates from 22 countries (76 medical centers), including countries in the Asia-Pacific region (32 isolates), Europe (264 isolates), Latin America (210 isolates), and the Middle East (19 isolates, Israel only) and the United States (61 isolates). The majority of isolates were K. pneumoniae (83.4\%); however, KPC was detected in 13 additional species. KPC-2 (69.6\%) was more common than KPC-3 (29.5\%), with regional variation observed. A novel KPC variant, KPC-18 (KPC-3[V8I]), was identified during the study. Few antimicrobial agents tested remained effective in vitro against KPC-producing isolates, with ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC$_{90}$, 4 μg/ml), aztreonam-avibactam (MIC$_{90}$, 0.5 μg/ml), and tigecycline (MIC$_{90}$, 2 μg/ml) retaining the greatest activity against Enterobacteriaceae cocarrying KPC and other β-lactamases, whereas colistin (MIC$_{90}$, 2 μg/ml) demonstrated the greatest in vitro activity against KPC-positive P. aeruginosa. This analysis of surveillance data demonstrated that KPC is widely disseminated. KPC was found in multiple species of Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa and has now become a global problem.},

	abstract = {Marine mammals are frequently considered good sentinels for human, animal and environmental health due to their long lifespan, coastal habitat, and characteristics as top chain predators. Using a One Health approach, marine mammals can provide information that helps to enhance the understanding of the health of the marine and coastal environment. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the quintessential One Health problem that poses a well-recognised threat to human, animal, and ecosystem health worldwide. Treated and untreated sewage, hospital waste and agricultural run-off are often responsible for the spread of AMR in marine and freshwater ecosystems. Rescued seals (n = 25) were used as sentinels to investigate the levels of AMR in the Irish coastal ecosystem. Faecal swabs were collected from these animals and bacterial isolates (E. coli and cefotaxime-resistant non-E. coli) from each swab were selected for further investigation. E. coli isolates were characterised in terms of phylogenetic group typing, AMR, and virulence factors. All E. coli isolates investigated in this study (n = 39) were ampicillin resistant while 26 (66.6\%) were multi-drug resistant (MDR). Resistance genes \textit{bla}$_{\text{OXA-1}}$ and \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-1}}$ were detected in 16/39 and 6/39 isolates, respectively. Additionally, virulence factors associated with adhesion (\textit{sfa}, \textit{papA}, and \textit{papC}) and siderophores (\textit{fyuA} and \textit{iutA}) were identified. An additional 19 faecal cefotaxime-resistant non-E. coli isolates were investigated for the presence of β-lactamase encoding genes. These isolates were identified as presumptive Leclercia, Pantoea and Enterobacter, however, none were positive for the presence of the genes investigated. To the authors knowledge this is the first study reporting the detection of \textit{bla}$_{\text{OXA-1}}$ and \textit{bla}$_{\text{TEM-1}}$ in phocid faecal E. coli in Europe. These results highlight the importance of marine mammals as sentinels for the presence and spread of AMR in the marine and coastal environment.},

In recent years there has been an increased incidence and prevalence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), enzymes that hydrolyze and cause resistance to oxyimino-cephalosporins and aztreonam. The majority of ESBLs are derived from the widespread broad-spectrum β-lactamases TEM-1 and SHV-1. There are also new families of ESBLs, including the CTX-M and OXA-type enzymes as well as novel, unrelated β-lactamases. Several different methods for the detection of ESBLs in clinical isolates have been suggested. While each of the tests has merit, none of the tests is able to detect all of the ESBLs encountered. ESBLs have become widespread throughout the world and are now found in a significant percentage of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in certain countries. They have also been found in other Enterobacteriaceae strains and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strains expressing these β-lactamases will present a host of therapeutic challenges as we head into the 21st century.},

However, only 1 of 26 isolates harboring class 2 integrons carried a gene cassette. Furthermore, both CRISPR 1 and 2 arrays were detected in most isolates (36 isolates; 73.5\%), followed by CRISPR 2 (18.4\%) and CRISPR 1 (4.1\%). Interestingly, CRISPR 2 was significantly more prevalent in multidrug resistant (MDR)-APEC isolates than in non-MDR APEC isolates, whereas CRISPR 3 and 4 were significantly more prevalent in non-MDR APEC isolates (each 11.1\%;

Our findings indicate that the distribution and characteristics of 3GC or 4GC-resistant APEC isolates differed among the integrated broiler operations; moreover, improved management protocols are needed to control the horizontal transmission of 3GC or 4GC-resistant APEC isolates.},

                AmpC β-lactamases are clinically important cephalosporinases encoded on the chromosomes of many of the Enterobacteriaceae and a few other organisms, where they mediate resistance to cephalothin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, most penicillins, and β-lactamase inhibitor-β-lactam combinations. In many bacteria, AmpC enzymes are inducible and can be expressed at high levels by mutation. Overexpression confers resistance to broad-spectrum cephalosporins including cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone and is a problem especially in infections due to Enterobacter aerogenes and Enterobacter cloacae, where an isolate initially susceptible to these agents may become resistant upon therapy. Transmissible plasmids have acquired genes for AmpC enzymes, which consequently can now appear in bacteria lacking or poorly expressing a chromosomal bla

Resistance due to plasmid-mediated AmpC enzymes is less common than extended-spectrum β-lactamase production in most parts of the world but may be both harder to detect and broader in spectrum. AmpC enzymes encoded by both chromosomal and plasmid genes are also evolving to hydrolyze broad-spectrum cephalosporins more efficiently. Techniques to identify AmpC β-lactamase-producing isolates are available but are still evolving and are not yet optimized for the clinical laboratory, which probably now underestimates this resistance mechanism. Carbapenems can usually be used to treat infections due to AmpC-producing bacteria, but carbapenem resistance can arise in some organisms by mutations that reduce influx (outer membrane porin loss) or enhance efflux (efflux pump activation).},

            SUMMARY
            
              β-Lactam antibiotics have been widely used as therapeutic agents for the past 70 years, resulting in emergence of an abundance of β-lactam-inactivating β-lactamases. Although penicillinases in
              Staphylococcus aureus
              challenged the initial uses of penicillin, β-lactamases are most important in Gram-negative bacteria, particularly in enteric and nonfermentative pathogens, where collectively they confer resistance to all β-lactam-containing antibiotics. Critical β-lactamases are those enzymes whose genes are encoded on mobile elements that are transferable among species. Major β-lactamase families include plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC cephalosporinases, and carbapenemases now appearing globally, with geographic preferences for specific variants. CTX-M enzymes include the most common ESBLs that are prevalent in all areas of the world. In contrast, KPC serine carbapenemases are present more frequently in the Americas, the Mediterranean countries, and China, whereas NDM metallo-β-lactamases are more prevalent in the Indian subcontinent and Eastern Europe. As selective pressure from β-lactam use continues, multiple β-lactamases per organism are increasingly common, including pathogens carrying three different carbapenemase genes. These organisms may be spread throughout health care facilities as well as in the community, warranting close attention to increased infection control measures and stewardship of the β-lactam-containing drugs in an effort to control selection of even more deleterious pathogens.},
